pip install numpy
pip install pandas
pip install scikit-learn
pip install keras
pip install matplotlib
pip install genetic-selection
pip install tensorflow


Note:-tensorflow is required because Keras now depends on it.

genetic-selection provides GeneticSelectionCV, which you are using to apply genetic algorithms for feature selection.

If you're using Python 3.10+, make sure versions of TensorFlow/Keras are compatible with your Python version.


Optional (for GUI display on some systems):
If you're using a minimal OS or a Linux environment without a display manager, you might also need:


sudo apt-get install python3-tk
